## Chemistry equations balancer

This program is a command-line tool to balance chemical equations. It is used here as an example program to test the JumboTrace tracing tool on a "real" program, in addition to the other simpler examples.

The program takes as argument an equation that it will try to balance, e.g. `C6H12O6 + O2 => H2O + CO2`. It displays the balanced equation in the console.
